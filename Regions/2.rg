-- This example moves the initialization and printing of the region into tasks.

--
-- Tasks that use regions must declare their privileges on the region's fields, which describe
-- how the task will use each field.  The clear task just writes to the bit field of the region.
-- Privileges are type checked by the Regent compiler: the task body and any subtasks called by the
-- task can only use the declared privileges.
--
-- Note the ttype of the region includes the types of the index and field spaces.
