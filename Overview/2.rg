import "regent"
local c = regentlib.c

-- This example illustrates some basic Regent syntax.
--   * The declaration of a local variable "sum".  Note variable declarations require a type and can
--     have an initializer.  Regent has type inference, so the type declarations on variables are not
--     strictly necessary, but declaring types is a good practice.  Standard Regent "style" is to declare
-- types for most variables, the primary exception being loop iteration variables.
--   * A simple "for" loop.  Note the iteration variable is implicitly declared ane the type is omitted.
--     The end of the body of the "for" loop is marked with the keyword "end".
--   * An "if" statement, with "elseif" and "else" branches.  This "if" is particularly silly, as only
--     the first branch is ever taken.  An "if" is also closed by an "end".

task main()
  var sum : int64 = 0
  for i = 1, 10 do
    sum += i
  end
  if sum >= 40 then
    sum -= 3
  elseif sum <= 30 then
    sum = 0
  else
    sum += 3
  end
  c.printf("The answer is %ld\n", sum)
end
