-- Some Lua code to import the regent library and include interfaces for standard C functions.
import "regent"
local c = regentlib.c

-- Tasks always begin with the keyword "task".  Tasks are Regent code, written in Regent syntax.
task main()
  c.printf("The answer is 42\n")
end

-- This the (Lua) command that kicks off the top-level task.
regentlib.start(main)
