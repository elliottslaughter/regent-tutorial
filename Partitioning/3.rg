-- Note that passing a partition as an argument also requires that the region from which
-- the partition was created is also passed as an argument so that Regent knows what
-- the privileges will be (the privileges on the parent region apply to any subregions as well).
--
-- The types here are interesting.  In particular, the partition has a type that includes the value
-- of the parent region (another reason knowledge of the parent region is required).
--
-- Finally, one might infer that passing the parent region as an argument is wasteful---do we
-- actually copy the entire parent region to whereever the launcher task runs?!  The answer is no,
-- we don't. Observe that launcher names the parent region as an argument but it isn't used in
-- the body --- only the subregions are actually referred to.  The Regent implementation makes a
-- distinction between naming a region and using its contents, and in this case the Regent compiler
-- will infer that it does not need a copy of the br region to run the launcher task.
